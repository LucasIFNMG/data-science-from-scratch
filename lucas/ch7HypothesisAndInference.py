""" What will we do with all this statistics and probability theory? The science part of data
science frequently involves forming and testing hypotheses about our data and the
processes that generate it. """

""" STATISTICAL HYPOTHESIS TESTING : H1 and H0. We have a null hypothesis H0 that
represents some default position, and some alternative hypothesis H1 that we'd
like to compare it with. We use statistics to decide whether we can reject H0
as false or not.

Ex: imagine we have a coin and we want to test whether it's fair. We'll make
the assumption that the coin has some probability p of landing heads, and so
our null hypothesis is that the coin is fair, that is, that p = 0.5. We'll test
this against the alternative hypothesis p != 0.5
